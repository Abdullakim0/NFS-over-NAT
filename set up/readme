# To see the available files
lsblk

# allowed me to partition the giant sda file.

sudo fdisk /dev/sda  # fdisk: This is a command-line utility used for disk partitioning

Once inside fdisk, I used the following commands (press m for help):
•	n: Create a new partition.
•	p: Print partition table.
•	d: Delete a partition.
•	w: Write changes to disk and exit.
•	q: Quit without saving changes.

There is also option to specify the size of the partition, in my case I created partitions
to seperate my files from directories, when the directory is mounted files aren't visible
from different partition, in order to double ensure the safety of my files. Also another
method to handle partitioning in one directory is to create image inside one directory.

umount -l /path/to/mounted/directory

If the umount is giving error like target is busy, then it is necessary to use the
command above -l (lazy). The -l option will detach the filesystem immediately and clean up
all references to the filesystem as soon as it's no longer busy.

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda # command used to create new filesystem. 

# Verification command:

sudo blkid /dev/sdb1

# Creating directory:

sudo mkdir /mnt/newdisk

# Mount the formatted partition to the mount point

sudo mount /dev/sda /mnt/newdisk


# Filesystem is overlay type, which is not supported to export NFS filesystem. Home directory is also overlay type. At least in my case.
# /dev/sda is special device path. It represents the entire first SCSI (or SATA) disk drive in the system. 
Device files in /dev are used by the operating system to communicate with hardware devices.
